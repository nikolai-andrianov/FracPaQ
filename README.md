# FracPaQ
Quantification of Fracture Patterns MATLAB scripts to quantify patterns of fractures in rocks and other materials. Developed by Dave Healy and others at the University of Aberdeen.

This repository contains the following modifications and bug fixes for plotting the fracture connectivity patterns:
- Added a new callback for traces connectivity on FracPaQ GUI;
- Fixed several bugs in getConnectivity related to the counting of X, Y, and I nodes;
- Hardcoded debug plotting of nodes.
